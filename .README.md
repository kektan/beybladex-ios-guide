# BEYBLADE X App for iOS/Apple users

I'm too lazy to write a cringe introduction so let's get straight to the point.  

# Creating a (new) Apple ID account
### This is to access the Japanese App Store

There's many ways to make a new account but for the purposes of this guide, I'll use the desktop website.  
NOTE: You don't NEED a VPN for this (which is why iOS is superior)

1. Go to [https://appleid.apple.com/account] to make a new account and follow as normal.
    * Make sure to select your region to Japan!!!
    * You can still use a US phone number to sign up.
2. If you are told to use an address, just pick a random McDonalds in Shibuya. (If you already have a proxy address, use that; it doesn't really matter.)
3. After doing a CAPTCHA and verifying email and phone number, your account should be made
